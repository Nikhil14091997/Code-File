Dear Sir/Madam,
		I am applying for a Quality Assurance Engineer Internship at Amazon India. As a graduate student in Computer Science Engineering and Computer Science Enthusiast since childhood, I have always seen the Amazon name associated with Software and other technological advancements and costumer interaction. I had the opportunity to speak with a close friend who was an intern last year at Amazon. He described a rewarding experience working and enjoyed the hands-on opportunities that were available to him.
I consider myself technologically sound and have a determined grip at Algorithms and Data Structures. I have also worked for my College SRM Institute of Science and Technology Modinagar, in developing projects.
Iâ€™m ready to move to a larger corporate structure and look forward to the learning opportunities offered. I am eager to discuss the possibility of an internship with you. If you have any questions or require any additional information, please contact me at +917042652437 or nikhil14091997@gmail.com
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Nikhil Kumar.
